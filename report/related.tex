Localization problems have been widely researched because location infromation of people, vehicles or any type of moving targets can be useful for providing the target's behavior, availability, safety and so on. Localizing targets outdoors has become relatively easier thanks to technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS). Indoor localization problems, however, are still under research from various viewpoints, for example, using wireless signals~\cite{liu2007}.
