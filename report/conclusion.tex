\label{sec:conclusion}

The main goal of this project was to implement a feasible semantic indoor localization system that can be used to locate a user's position on a map who is carrying a smartphone so that the person does not need any additional device. Producing information of the semantic spaces was realized by using an ultrasound signal generator that generates sinusoids with specific frequencies and the sinusoids conveyed IDs of rooms in the environment. An Android application was implemented in order to collect audio samples to be decoded into room information using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and a couple of filtering algorithms. Calculated location information could be either sent to a server that can aggregate multiple targets' location or kept secret for the user's privacy. This main goal of the project was mostly achieved throughout this semester and we illustrated how accurate and efficient this localization system is by various kinds of experiments. Power consumption caused by this Android application imposed mild overhead on the smartphone, this system showed clear and accurate results even though when there was noise and interference. Through additional evaluation such as tests for room coverage and obstacle blocking, we also proved this system is proper for indoor characteristics.
