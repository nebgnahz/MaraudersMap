\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

While Global Positioning System (GPS)~\cite{hofmann1993global} has been extensively relied on recently for many applications such as navigation, geo-tagging, etc, it doesn't work well for indoor environment due to the block of line-of-sight to satellites. Various approaches have been investigated to achieve precise indoor localization, and a sizable number of those researches are trying to localize specific devices or sensor nodes, and many have associate these ``tags'' with human to achieve location-based services. 

Such investigation gets another wave of attention after the emerging smartphones which act naturally as everyone's tag. Though limited by types of sensors, most smartphones are equipped with cellular, Wifi, Bluetooth, inertial measurement unit (IMU), microphone, camera, speaker, etc. Lastest smartphones may even support near field communication (NFC), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), proximity sensor, light sensor and even barometer. These sensors have make smartphones not only primarily for communication, but also become such embedded programming platform that many researchers can fast prototype and deploy systems to a large amount of users. And among them are the indoor localization systems.

Although a fair amount of them are concentrating on providing precise 3D coordinates as the localization results (mainly relying on the RF signal attenuation and triangulation), recently focus has been shifted to address room-level detection as the localization results. This change has been mainly inspired from the requirements of many applications, but has converted the localization problem to a classification problem, where the main challenge is to find the proper signature/feature to assist the classifier.

However, most existing signatures (Cellular, Wifi, FM, Acoustic Background Sound), are not precise to provide high accuracy of detection. In this project, we propose that it's easy to create reliable man-made signature of each room with little infrastructure installation -- by deploying ultrasound beacons in each room could provide such signature. And the best part of this approach is the utilization of the ultrasound signal reflection inside each room. Another great benefit is the pervasive existence of microphone on smartphones. Since we do not require any distance information being calculated, no synchronization or sophiscated encoding scheme is needed. The entire system is fairly simple yet effective.

We will detail our design and implementation in this paper with the structure as follows. Related indoor localization investigation will be discussed in Sec.\,\ref{sec:related-works}. And in Sec.\,\ref{sec:system-architecture}, we focus on the design of the system architecture. The implementation details are in Sec.\,\ref{sec:implementation}, which is followed by the evaluation in Sec.\,\ref{sec:evaluation}. Potential future work lies in Sec.\,\ref{sec:future-work} and Sec.\,\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes this paper.
