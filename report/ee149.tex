\begin{abstract}
In this project, we have designed and implemented an ultrasound-based indoor localization system (named Marauder's Map), which could tell the semantic location of a smartphone holder.
Based on the observation that almost all the smartphones are capable of detecting human-inaudiable sound (20kHz - 22kHz), we use the ultrasound beacon to broadcast the unique room ID.
Effective filtering algorithm that processing such sound signal yields a pretty good accuracy (over 90\%) against most noises like claps, speeches, coughes.
 % we probably have to test this a bit %
