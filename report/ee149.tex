\begin{abstract}
Indoor localization has been studied for a long time due to a considerable number of applications' requirement. While the ability of providing precise geo-location is important, researches have identified that most applications only require semantic location.

In this paper, we propose the semantic localization concept, and demonstrate its effectiveness. To achieve it, we also designed and implemented an ultrasound-based indoor localization system (named Marauder's Map), which could tell the semantic location of a smartphone holder.

\section*{Acknowledgment}
To begin with, we would like to express our gratitude to Professor Edward A. Lee and Professor Sanjit A. Seshia for teaching and guiding us to finish this course and course project successfully. We also thank our GSI, Zach Wasson for helping us to learn practical knowledge through labs and giving us feedbacks, and our project mentor, Tomi R{\"a}ty for giving us advice on the direction of this project and frequent discussion on the progress. And we also want to thank all the other people with whom we had interesting discussions about the indoor localization problem.
