   Abstract = {This book provides an accessible introduction to signals and systems for electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science students, and is based on several years of successful classroom use at the University of California, Berkeley. The material starts with an early introduction to applications, well before students have built up enough theory to fully analyze the applications. This motivates students to learn the theory and allows students to master signals and systems at the sophomore level. The material motivates signals and systems through sound and images, as opposed to circuits, and as such calculus is the only prerequisite.},

It argues that to realize its full potential, the core abstractions of computing need to be rethought to incorporate essential properties of the physical systems, most particularly the passage of time. It makes a case that the solution cannot be simply overlaid on existing abstractions, and outlines a number of promising approaches being pursued. The emphasis needs to be on repeatable behavior rather than on performance optimization.},

   Abstract = {Reliable, fast and deterministic transmission of control information in a network is a need for many distributed systems. One example is timing systems, where a reference frequency is used to accurately schedule time-critical messages. The White Rabbit (WR) project is a multi-laboratory and multi-company effort to bring together the best of the data transfer and timing worlds in a completely open design. It takes advantage of the latest developments for improving timing over Ethernet, such as IEEE 1588 (Precision Time Protocol) and Synchronous Ethernet. The presented approach aims for a general purpose, fieldbus-like transmission system, which provides deterministic data and timing (sub-ns accuracy and ps jitter) to around 1000 stations. It automatically compensates for fiber lengths in the order of 10 km. This paper describes the WR design goals and the specification used for the project. It goes on to describe the central component of the WR system structure - the WR switch - with theoretical considerations about the requirements. Finally, it presents real timing measurements for the first prototypes of WR hardware.},

   Journal = {The Journal of Systems and Software},
   Volume = {82},
   Pages = {112-120},
   Abstract = {Heterogeneous systems mix different technical domains such as signal processing, analog and digital
electronics, software, telecommunication protocols, etc. Heterogeneous systems are composed of subsystems
that are designed using different models of computation (MoC). These MoCs are the laws that govern
the interactions of the components of a subsystem. The design of heterogeneous systems includes the
design of each part of the system according to its specific MoC, and the connection of the parts in order to
build the model representing the system. Indeed, this model allows the MoCs that govern different parts
of system to coexist and interact.
To be able to use a component which is specified according to a given MoC, under other, different MoCs,
we can use either a hierarchical or a non-hierarchical approach, or we can build domain-specific components
(DSC). However, these solutions present several disadvantages. This paper presents a new model of
component, called domain-polymorph component (DPC). Such a component is atomic and is able to execute
its core behavior, specified under a given MoC, under different host MoCs. This approach is not a
competitor to the approaches above but is complementary.},

We co-design the control law and the task scheduling algorithm for predictable performance and power consumption for both the computing and the physical systems. We use a typical example, multiple inverted pendulums controlled by one processor, to illustrate our method.

   Abstract = {Ptolemy II is an open source environment for system design and test based on component data flow. This paradigm tries to make parallel systems more deterministic and understandable. In this work we propose a technique to translate designs developed with Ptolemy II, into multithreaded Java implementations on multicore platforms. We have chosen Java mainly because Ptolemy II is implemented in Java and then we get direct code reuse. The counterpart is a certain amount of overhead that we expect to be less relevant as Java runtime environment will evolve. The main goals are to produce efficient parallel simulators and software devices with competitive performance level. We show by means of an example that the first goal is easy to achieve. The application context that we are interested on is video codec design suitable for wireless networks with variable bandwidth and noise constraints. },

   BookTitle = {Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS)},
   Pages = {49 - 60},
   Abstract = {Summary:In multiprocessor systems, the traffic on the bus does not solely originate from data transfers due to data dependencies between tasks, but is also affected by memory transfers as result of cache misses. This has a huge impact on worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis and, in general, on the predictability of real-time applications implemented on such systems. As opposed to the WCET analysis performed for a single processor system, where the cache miss penalty is considered constant, in a multiprocessor system each cache miss has a variable penalty, depending on the bus contention. This affects the tasks' WCET which, however, is needed in order to perform system scheduling. At the same time, the WCET depends on the system schedule due to the bus interference. In this paper we present an approach to worst-case execution time analysis and system scheduling for real-time applications implemented on multiprocessor SoC architectures. The emphasis of this paper is on the bus scheduling policy and its optimization, which is of huge importance for the performance of such a predictable multiprocessor application.},

   Abstract = {Bridging the gap between model-based design and platformbased
implementation is one of the critical challenges for
embedded software systems. In the context of embedded
control systems that interact with an environment, a variety
of errors due to quantization, delays, and scheduling
policies may generate executable code that does not faithfully
implement the model-based design. In this paper, we
show that the performance gap between the model-level semantics
of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers
and their implementation-level semantics can be rigorously
quantified if the controller implementation is executed on a
predictable time-triggered architecture. Our technical approach
uses lifting techniques for periodic, time-varying linear
systems in order to compute the exact error between
the model semantics and the execution semantics. Explicitly
computing the impact of the implementation on overall
system performance allows us to compare and partially order
different implementations with various scheduling or timing
characteristics.},

We argue that the gap between the model and the implementation can be rigorously quantified leading to predictability if the implementation is viewed as a sequence of control blocks executed in statically allocated time slots on a time-triggered platform. For linear systems controlled by linear controllers, we show how to calculate the exact error between the model-level semantics and the execution semantics of an implementation, allowing us to compare different implementations. The calculated error of different implementations is demonstrated using simulations on illustrative examples},

   Abstract = {During the software crisis of the 1960s, Dijkstra�s famous thesis �goto considered harmful� paved
the way for structured programming. This short communication suggests that many current difficulties
of parallel programming based on message passing are caused by poorly structured communication,
which is a consequence of using low-level send-receive primitives.We argue that, like goto
in sequential programs, send-receive should be avoided as far as possible and replaced by collective
operations in the setting of message passing. We dispute some widely held opinions about the
apparent superiority of pairwise communication over collective communication and present substantial
theoretical and empirical evidence to the contrary in the context of MPI (Message Passing
Interface).},

   Abstract = {We present a new high-level programming language, called xGiotto, for programming applications with hard real-time constraints. Like its predecessor, xGiotto is based on the LET (logical execution time) assumption: the programmer specifies when the outputs of a task become available, and the compiler checks if the specification can be implemented on a given platform. However, while the predecessor language Giotto was purely time-triggered, xGiotto accommodates also asynchronous events. Indeed, through a mechanism called event scoping, events are the main structuring principle of the new language. The xGiotto compiler and run-time system implement event scoping through a tree-based event filter. The compiler also checks programs for determinism (absence of race conditions) and time safety (schedulability).},

   Abstract = {Integrating formal methods enhances their power as an intellectual tool in modelling and design. This holds regardless of automation, but a fortiori if software tools are conceived in an integrated framework.
Among the many approaches to integration, most valuable are those with the widest potential impact and least obsolescence or dependency on technology or particular tool-oriented paradigms. From a practical view, integration by unifying models leads to more uniform, wider-spectrum, yet simpler language design in automated tools for formal methods.
Hence this paper shows abstractions that cut across levels and boundaries between disciplines, help unifying the growing diversity of aspects now covered by separate formal methods and mathematical models, and even bridge the gap between continuous and discrete systems. The abstractions also yield conceptual simplification by hiding non-essential differences, avoiding repeating the same theory in different guises.
The underlying framework, not being the main topic, is outlined quite tersely, but enough for showing the preferred formalism to express and reason about the abstract paradigms of interest. Three such paradigms are presented in sufficient detail to appreciate the surprisingly wide scope of the obtained unification. The function extension paradigm is useful from signal processing to functional predicate calculus. The function tolerance paradigm spans the spectrum from analog filters to record types, relational databases and XML semantics. The coordinate space paradigm covers modelling issues ranging from transmission lines to formal semantics, stochatic processes and temporal calculi. One conclusion is that integrated formal methods are best served by calculational tools.
Keywords. Abstraction, continuous, discrete, hybrid systems, databases, filters, formal methods, function extension, function tolerance, integration, predicate calculus, quantification, semantics, signal processing, transmission lines, unification, XML.},

should expose the tradeoff between accuracy and resource usage, allowing
applications to adapt to changing network conditions and tune
energy and bandwidth requirements. We describe abstract regions, a
family of spatial operators that capture local communication within regions
of the network, which may be defined in terms of radio connectivity,
geographic location, or other properties of nodes. Abstract regions
provide feedback on the quality of collective operations, and expose an
interface for tuning resource consumption. We present the implementation
of abstract regions in the TinyOS programming environment, as
well as preliminary results demonstrating their use for building adaptive
sensor network applications.},

There is no distinction between the user environment and the development environment. Croquet is focused on interactions inside of a 3D shared space that is used for context based collaboration, where each user can see all of the others and what their current focus is. This allows for an extremely compelling shared experience. A new collaboration architecture/protocol called TeaTime has been developed to enable this functionality. The rendering architecture is built on top of OpenGL.},

   Abstract = {We present an algorithm called TAR ("Thread-modular Abstraction Refinement") for model checking safety properties of concurrent software. The TAR algorithm uses thread-modular assume-guarantee reasoning to overcome the exponential complexity in the control state of multithreaded programs. Thread modularity means that TAR explores the state space of one thread at a time, making assumptions about how the environment can interfere. The TAR algorithm uses counterexample-guided predicate-abstraction refinement to overcome the usually infinite complexity in the data state of C programs. A successive approximation scheme automatically infers the necessary precision on data variables as well as suitable environment assumptions. The scheme is novel in that transition relations are approximated from above, while at the same time environment assumptions are approximated from below. In our software verification tool Blast we have implemented a fully automatic race checker for multithreaded C programs which is based on the TAR algorithm. This tool has verified a wide variety of commonly used locking idioms, including locking schemes that are not amenable to existing dynamic and static race checkers such as Eraser or Warlock.},

   Address= {San Jose, CA, USA},
   Pages = {85-95},
   Abstract = {Composed of tens of thousands of tiny devices with very
limited resources ("motes"), sensor networks are subject to
novel systems problems and constraints. The large number
of motes in a sensor network means that there will often
be some failing nodes; networks must be easy to repopu-
late. Often there is no feasible method to recharge motes,
so energy is a precious resource. Once deployed, a network
must be reprogrammable although physically unreachable,
and this reprogramming can be a significant energy cost.
We present Mate', a tiny communication-centric virtual
machine designed for sensor networks. Mate's high-level in-
terface allows complex programs to be very short (under
100 bytes), reducing the energy cost of transmitting new
programs. Code is broken up into small capsules of 24
instructions, which can self-replicate through the network.
Packet sending and reception capsules enable the deploy-
ment of ad-hoc routing and data aggregation algorithms.
Mat~'s concise, high-level program representation simplifies
programming and allows large networks to be frequently re-
programmed in an energy-efficient manner; in addition, its
safe execution environment suggests a use of virtual ma-
chines to provide the user/kernel boundary on motes that
have no hardware protection mechanisms.},

   Abstract = {One approach to model checking software is based on the abstract-check-refine paradigm: build an abstract model, then check the desired property, and if the check fails, refine the model and start over. We introduce the concept of lazy abstraction to integrate and optimize the three phases of the abstract-check-refine loop. Lazy abstraction continuously builds and refines a single abstract model on demand, driven by the model checker, so that different parts of the model may exhibit different degrees of precision, namely just enough to verify the desired property. We present an algorithm for model checking safety properties using lazy abstraction and describe an implementation of the algorithm applied to C programs. We also provide sufficient conditions for the termination of the method.},

   Title = {Mining Specifications},
   BookTitle = {POPL '02},
   Address= {Portland, OR},
   Abstract = {Program verification is a promising approach to improving program
quality, because it can search all possible program executions for
specic errors. However, the need to formally describe correct behavior
or errors is a major barrier to the widespread adoption of
program verication, since programmers historically have been reluctant
to write formal specications. Automating the process of
formulating specications would remove a barrier to program verification and enhance its practicality.
This paper describes specification mining, a machine learning
approach to discovering formal specifications of the protocols that
code must obey when interacting with an application program interface
or abstract data type. Starting from the assumption that a
working program is well enough debugged to reveal strong hints
of correct protocols, our tool infers a specification by observing
program execution and concisely summarizing the frequent interaction
patterns as state machines that capture both temporal and
data dependences. These state machines can be examined by a programmer,
to refine the specication and identify errors, and can be
utilized by automatic verication tools, to find bugs.
Our preliminary experience with the mining tool has been
promising. We were able to learn specifications that not only captured
the correct protocol, but also discovered serious bugs.},

   BookTitle = {USENIX},
   Abstract = {Cooperative task management can provide program architects
with ease of reasoning about concurrency issues.
This property is often espoused by those who
recommend �event-driven� programming over �multithreaded�
programming. Those terms conflate several
issues. In this paper, we clarify the issues, and show how
one can get the best of both worlds: reason more simply
about concurrency in the way �event-driven� advocates
recommend, while preserving the readability and maintainability
of code associated with �multithreaded� programming.
We identify the source of confusion about the two programming
styles as a conflation of two concepts: task
management and stack management. Those two concerns
define a two-axis space in which �multithreaded�
and �event-driven� programming are diagonally opposite;
there is a third �sweet spot� in the space that combines
the advantages of both programming styles. We
point out pitfalls in both alternative forms of stack management,
manual and automatic, and we supply techniques
that mitigate the danger in the automatic case.
Finally, we exhibit adaptors that enable automatic stack
management code and manual stack management code
to interoperate in the same code base.},

   Abstract = {We propose a new design for highly concurrent Internet services, which
we call the staged event-driven architecture (SEDA). SEDA is intended
to support massive concurrency demands and simplify the construction
of well-conditioned services. In SEDA, applications consist of a
network of event-driven stages connected by explicit queues. This architecture
allows services to be well-conditioned to load, preventing
resources from being overcommitted when demand exceeds service capacity.
SEDA makes use of a set of dynamic resource controllers to
keep stages within their operating regime despite large fluctuations in
load. We describe several control mechanisms for automatic tuning
and load conditioning, including thread pool sizing, event batching, and
adaptive load shedding. We present the SEDA design and an implementation
of an Internet services platform based on this architecture. We
evaluate the use of SEDA through two applications: a high-performance
HTTP server and a packet router for the Gnutella peer-to-peer file sharing
network. These results show that SEDA applications exhibit higher
performance than traditional service designs, and are robust to huge
variations in load.},

Specifically, we use an automata-based language to capture both input assumptions about the order in which the methods of a component are called, and output guarantees about the order in which the component calls external methods. The formalism supports automatic compatibility checks between interface models, and thus constitutes a type system for component interaction. Unlike traditional uses of automata, our formalism is based on an optimistic approach to composition, and on an alternating approach to design refinement. According to the optimistic approach, two components are compatible if there is some environment that can make them work together. According to the alternating approach, one interface refines another if it has weaker input assumptions, and stronger output guarantees. We show that these notions have game-theoretic foundations that lead to efficient algorithms for checking compatibility and refinement.},

In OSW, components called "transforms" are dynamically configured into larger units called "patches." New components can be expressed using familiar mathematical definitions without deep knowledge of C++. High-level specifications of transforms are created using the "Externalizer," and are compiled and loaded into a running OSW environment. ...},

   Abstract = {Abstract: The paper describes an algebraic framework for the study of dataflow networks, which form a paradigm for concurrent computation in which a collection of concurrently and asynchronously executing processes communicate by sending messages between ports connected via FIFO message channels. A syntactic dataflow calculus is defined, having two kinds of terms which represent networks and computations, respectively. By imposing suitable equivalences on networks and computations, we obtain the free dataflow algebra, in which the dataflow networks with m input ports and n output ports are regarded as the objects of a category S/sub m//sup n/, and the computations of such networks are represented by the arrows. Functors defined on S/sub m//sup n/ label each computation by the input buffer consumed and the computations buffer produced during that computation, so that each S/sub m//sup n/ is a span in Cat. It is shown that the free dataflow algebra construction underlies a monad in the category of collections S=(S/sub m//sup n/:m,n>or=0) of spans in Cat. The algebras of this monad, called dataflow algebras, have a monoid structure representing parallel composition, and are also equipped with an action of a certain collection of continuous functions, thereby representing the formation of feedback loops. The two structures are related by a distributive law of feedback over parallel composition. We also observe the following connection with the theory of fibrations: if S is a dataflow algebra, then each S/sub m//sup n/ is a split bifibration in Cat.},

   Abstract = {Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is currently being hyped as the best way to do everything from promoting code reuse to forming lasting relationships with persons of your preferred sexual orientation. This paper tries to demystify the benefits of OOP. We point out that, as with so many previous software engineering fads, the biggest gains in using OOP result from applying principles that are older than, and largely independent of, OOP. Moreover, many of the claimed benefits are either not true or true only by chance, while occasioning some high costs that are rarely discussed. Most seriously, all the hype is preventing progress in tackling problems that are both more important and harder: control of parallel and distributed applications, GUI design and implementation, fault tolerant and real-time programming. OOP has little to offer these areas. Fundamentally, you get good software by thinking about it, designing it well, implementing it carefully, and testing it intelligently, not by mindlessly using an expensive mechanical process.},

Using TLA (the temporal logic of actions), we illustrate how they work with the examples of a queue and of a mutual-exclusion protocol. In general, two problems must be addressed: avoiding the real-time programming version of Zeno's paradox, and coping with circularities when composing real-time assumption/guarantee specifications. Their solutions rest on properties of machine closure and realizability.},

   BookTitle = {Second International Symposium on Operating Systems},
   Volume = {13},
   Pages = {3-19},
   Abstract = {Many operating system designs can be placed into one of two very rough categories,
depending upon how they implement and use the notions of process and
synchronization. One category, the "Message-oriented System," is characterized by a
relatively small, static number of processes with an explicit message system for
communicating among them. The other category, the "Procedure-oriented System," is
characterized by a large, rapidly changing number of small processes and a process
synchronization mechanism based on shared data.
In this paper, it is demonstrated that these two categories are duals of each other and
that a system which is constructed according to one model has a direct counterpart in
the other. The principal conclusion is that neither model is inherently preferable, and the
main consideration for choosing between them is the nature of the machine architecture
upon which the system is being built, not the application which the system will ultimately
support. },
